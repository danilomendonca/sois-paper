\section{Evaluation and Discussion}\label{sec:evaluation}


\subsection{Underlying Framework}

While the choice of a specific framework is orthogonal to the main concepts and the self-organization mechanisms presented by this work, we considered the arguments for a resource-oriented architecture~\cite{PRIME} and adopted IoTivity as the underlying framework on top of which the abstractions and mechanisms of self-organizing edge spaces are built and operate.
