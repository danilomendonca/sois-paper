A3Droid provides a valuable starting point for crowdsensing applications that follow a fog-like architecture. Its simple yet powerful design allows developers to implement robust and scalable crowdsensing by simply extending the corresponding framework's classes. 

%In our example, the complex task of gathering multiple geolocation data from moving devices became a simple matter of implementing the Android GPS data retrieval; the lower-level network procedures for sending and receiving the collected data were provided out-of-the-box by A3Droid. Furthermore, the application was made robust through a simple fitness function that considered the amount of time the followers were expected to remain on the bus. 

%More sophisticated requirements could be achieved by defining other types of messages and behaviour for followers and supervisor.

Considering the number of smartphones already carried by humans, and the expected growth in the area of wearables, crowdsensing will need to be able to scale to hundreds of devices in the future. In this sense, in our future work, we will investigate how A3Droid behaves with a higher number of devices. This will also allow us to better assess how A-3's TCOs can help preserve performance in different contexts of operation. Finally, we are interested in assessing A3Droid's capabilities with different network technologies, like bluetooth and WiFi direct.
