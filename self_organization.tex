\section{Self-organization Mechanisms}\label{sec:self_organization}


%While self-organization principles have been extensively used in the context of multi-agents and robots, as well as in other fields, they have mostly addressed the achievement of a specific set of application goals (e.g., in the design of rescue robots that, based on their local knowledge, actions, and interactions, will lead to the emergent behavior of finding and rescuing the victims). In contrast, in this work self-organization means the literal self-adaptation of the system organization. 

%Additionally, bio-inspired and other self-organization methods have a strong relation with the restrictions imposed by the physical world. For instance, the actions of a robot are based on its own knowledge and the knowledge it receives from its neighbors. In many cases, this is due to the limitation in the communication methods. The concept of a neighbor is, in this case, determined by spatial proximity. However, if the communication method is powerful enough to let all robots to exchange information, the concept of a neighbor cannot be determined by the spatial vicinity.

%1: On the need for a maleable organization structure
The structure of the application organization
%, formed by the two abstractions presented -- namely, roles and groups -- 
must be malleable (plastic) to accommodate changes in the units composing the pervasive ecosystem and in its physical environment. 

%2: What must evolve
In contrast with the much less dynamic cases of organizations in human societies (e.g. industry and military organizations), the volatility that affects and characterizes pervasive and mobile devices, caused by their mobility or fluctuations of their resources, may imply the formation or dissolution of relations among nodes and require the reassessment of the roles they play in the organization.

%3: What self-organization means in the literature
%TODO: move this to the related works
Self-organization have been extensively studied in the context of multi-agents and other fields as a phenomena and method to achieve system properties and goals by means of actions and interactions between individuals based on their local knowledge and no external control~\cite{DiMarzoSerugendo:2005, Banzhaf:2009}. In contrast, self-organization in this work refers to the constitution and adaptation of the application organization as understood by the serendipitous relations between application nodes formed and dissolved while the are able to communicate and collaborate. In specific, we propose mechanisms for each of the following organization aspects:


%Whereas the self-organization principles of discentralization and local knowledge based decisions are followed by our proposed mechanisms, However, whereas the majority of works in the literature~\cite{} employ self-organization as a means to achieve system goals through emergency, we employ self-organization mechanisms reason on a meta-level: on the roles that may or must be played by application nodes given the social and individual context they are in.  
%to the extent of shared by interconnected nodes,
%shared by interconnected nodes
 




%The long term evolution of the system has also been studied 

%As an example, rescue robots are designed to decide where to go next based on their own sensors or the knowledge received from other robots they meet~\cite{}. will lead to the emergent behavior of finding and rescuing the victims). In contrast, in this work self-organization means the literal self-adaptation of the system organization. 

%The term \textit{self-organization} have been mostly used to refer to emergent behaviors of the system based on local knowledge and actions~\cite{SELF_ORGANIZATION^4}. In this work, it denotes the distributed and autonomous adaptation of the system organization in the advent of context changes, i.e., it literally means \textit{self-organization} of the ecosystem formed by the application nodes. Nonetheless, the self-organization mechanisms proposed here share many of the characteristics of ....:

%\begin{itemize}
%	
%	\item \textbf{No external control:} no external component participates in the decision making to adapt the organization;
%	
%	\item \textbf{Distributed decision making:} ... 
%	
%\end{itemize}

%In this sense, each application node takes part in the process of perceiving its individual context (availability of resources, capabilities), as well as its social context (with who the node can interact). In this paper, we focus on two different self-organization mechanisms:

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Group membership:} as nodes join or leave a group, a group registry must be kept consistent among members;
	%a node must join or leave a group according to its satisfaction to the criteria in that group; 
	to address this, a \textit{self-grouping} mechanism is proposed;
	
	\item \textbf{Role allocation:} the nodes within a group must agree on which roles they shall play; to address this, a  \textit{discentralized role election} mechanism is proposed;
	
%	\item \textbf{Role cardinality:} the relation between the number of instances of a role and attributes of system may vary with the context; to address this, a \textit{role cardinality}  mechanism is proposed;
%	
%	\item \textbf{Group cardinality:} finally, in some situations the membership criteria may have to be relaxed to allow more nodes to join a group and achieve its goals; to address this, \textit{group cardinality} mechanism is proposed.
	
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Self-grouping} 

%mobile crowdsensing campaigns may target specific city areas; thus, only the nodes which are currently within these areas are eligible for participating of the respective campaigns. Campaign groups can be modeled with a physical criteria specifying the geolocation coordinates of the area (Figure~\ref{fig:spatial_criteria}). Also, specific sensing activities may also correspond to groups using the hardware membership criteria (Figure~\ref{fig:virtual_criteria}).


%TODO: replace the figures bellow with a MC example

\subsubsection{\textbf{Definition}} As the idea of a group in this work is not related to security, the \textit{self-grouping} mechanism is not controlled by special-purpose components external to the system; instead, each node is responsible for checking its own satisfaction to the existing membership criteria in the application organization. 

Whenever an application group comes into contact with others and join an existing group, this event must be  advertised to current members, who in turn update their group membership registry. Analogously, when a member node leaves, this event must also be perceived by existing members, who must update their registry.

\subsubsection{\textbf{Grouping Protocol}} 

%1: Check restrictive criteria
A node should join a group if it satisfies all restrictive criteria of at least one of the roles (hereafter referred to as RRC) in that group. In this paper, we assume the group specification to be performed off-line and be available for each application node as part of its resources (e.g., as an XML specification, as depicted in Section~\ref{sec:group_specification}). Thus, each node have access the restrictive criteria of roles in a group specification and can locally check for their satisfaction. 

%Once it is able to join a group, the decision of which role to play is based on the group specification and the different membership strategies as defined in Section~\ref{sec:groups}.

The diagrams in Figures~\ref{fig:join_or_leave} and~\ref{fig:registry_replica} present the activities of the self-grouping protocol. At each iteration, the node checks for its satisfaction of the RRC (Figure~\ref{fig:join_or_leave}, activity 1). If no RRC is satisfied and the node is currently a member, it must leave the group and advertise this event to the other members (Figure~\ref{fig:join_or_leave}, activity 2). Conversely, if a node satisfies an RRC, it proceed by joining the group and advertise this event (Figure~\ref{fig:join_or_leave}, activity 3). Last but not least, as nodes entering a group have no information about its current members, this knowledge must be acquired. In specific, after been notified about the new member, the oldest group member is responsible for sending the registry replica to the newcomer (Figure~\ref{fig:registry_replica}, activity 1).

	\label{fig:role_allocation}
\end{figure}
 
\subsubsection{\textbf{Definition}} The decision of which nodes should be assigned to which roles in a group may depend on many aspects. Any node capable of performing a role is a potential candidate. Notwithstanding this, attribute such as the wireless connections throughput, sensors accuracy, as well as the availability of resources like battery, memory and processing capacity tend to variate from one node to another and throughout time. Thus, a balanced role allocation must respect the trade off between what is best for the application goals and for the individual devices. 

%In specific, we adopt the definition of context as...+++..., including their physical and the social contexts; in specific, context is reified as:
%
%\begin{itemize} 
%	
%	\item which application nodes are currently present (provided by existing discovery mechanisms);
%	
%	\item the capability and fitness of these nodes to perform functionalities required by the application (addressed by this framework).
%	
%\end{itemize}

%Despite the many possible types of asymmetric tasks, in this paper we focus on those whose importance for the application and cost for the devices are significant, i.e., the computation and communication overhead for its allocating is justified. 


%The later is specially important in volunteer based applications such as mobile crowdsensing, as efficient and fair use of devices resources works as an incentive for participation. 

%FIGURE: META MODEL FOR NODE-ROLE

%\textbf{Requirements} As the we consider a scenario in which application nodes hosted by volatile and resource constrained devices must self-organize their activities, the allocation method shall satisfy the following requirements:
%
%\begin{enumerate}[label=R\arabic*.]
%	
%	\item Distributed: allocation decision should not be centralized by one device in order to avoid bottlenecks;
%	
%	\item Communication overhead: only essential data should be exchanged in order to minimize communication overhead; 
%	
%	\item Coherence: the allocation method performance/cost should be tuned according to the role constraints and criticality.
%	  
%\end{enumerate}  

%Thus, our method for role allocation follows the classification and algorithm from existing works.

\subsubsection{\textbf{Allocation Classification}} Gerkey and Matarić~\cite{Gerkey:2004} proposed a taxonomy for the classification of task allocation problems along three axes. We adopted this taxonomy as a means to improve the characterization of the role allocation problem.

In the first axis, robots~\footnote{in their proposed taxonomy, the authors refers to \textit{robots} and \textit{tasks}, while in this paper we refer to the (application) \textit{nodes} and the \textit{roles} they can perform.} 
are categorized into single-task versus multi-task robots. In the second axis, tasks are categorized into single-robot versus multi-robot tasks. Finally, in the third axis, the allocation is also categorized into two types: instantaneous assignment or time-extended assignment.

Regarding the first axis, as application nodes are generally capable of performing more than one role at a time (e.g., to fetch from multiple types of sensors) nodes are here considered as multi-role (analogous to multi-task robots in ~\cite{Gerkey:2004}). Regarding the second axis, many types of roles are to be performed by a single application node (e.g., the sensor data aggregator role), while others must be simultaneously performed by multiple nodes (e.g., simultaneously fetch from the same type of sensor). Thus, roles can be either single-node (analogous to single-robot tasks in ~\cite{Gerkey:2004}) or multi-node (analogous to multi-robot tasks in ~\cite{Gerkey:2004}). Finally, due to the volatility of mobile devices, including churn and fluctuations of their capabilities, the scheduling of future allocations tends to fail. Accordingly, we consider an instantaneous and adaptable assignment of roles based on the context of the involved devices. 

\subsubsection{\textbf{Allocation Method}} Auction-based allocation methods have been extensively studied in the multi-agents/robots domain~\cite{Korsah:2013}. In comparison with the task allocation problem tackled by auction-based methods, an assignment of roles to pervasive and mobile devices subject to high volatility needs to evolve as nodes leave or join the system and their fitness change. If the assignment should continuously reflect any context change, a frequent message exchange between bidding and auctioneers would lead to excessive communication overhead. Accordingly, the replacement of existing role positions (herein referred as reelection) should take into account the trade off between the gain of having a more fit node elected and the replacement cost. 

%To mitigate this problem, nodes should evaluate their fitness (self-evaluation) and only advertise it to other group members if a delta in the value occurs.

To address this problem, we propose an event-based protocol inspired in electoral systems. Accordingly, instead of reevaluating and potentially changing the assignment of role positions at fixed control periods, we define the set of events in which new elections for these positions should be performed (event-triggered control). In specific, these events are:	

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Vacancy:} a new role position is opened or the node playing a role exists the system (churn) due to a network disconnection from the remaining nodes or the abnormal termination of the application instance after a failure;
	
	\item \textbf{Resignation:} the node playing a role calls for a new election before quitting; e.g., the application node is exiting the system following a termination command issued by the users or the operational system;
	
	\item \textbf{Challenge:} one of eligible nodes calls for a new election after detecting it has a significantly higher fitness score for that role position than the actual node by the time it was elected;
	
	%\item \textbf{Consensus:} the set of nodes dependent from a functionality provided by an elected node calls for a new election; e.g., the latency experienced between a set of nodes and an elected node is high despite its higher fitness to play that role (latency is not part of the fitness criteria);
	
\end{itemize}
\medskip
 
The subtitle difference between vacancy and resignation consists of the way it is handled: the former implies in a \textit{vacant} period in which the role functionality is interrupted until the vacancy is detected and occupied (hard transition), whereas the later allows the replacement of the position before discontinuing the functionality provided by the resigning node (soft transition). 

In both cases, the eligible nodes must proceed with the election of a candidate by checking their current fitness score ($FS$) and advertising it (bidding). After receiving the fitness scores from all other candidates, each node becomes aware of the election result. Thus, each node proceeds either by: assuming the role position and registering itself as the winner (if it has the highest $FS$); or registering the identify of the winner (otherwise). 

The later case presents an inverse situation: the caller of the election is a node that perceives its actual fitness score ($FS_a$) as higher than the value scored by the elected node by time it was elected ($FS_e$). Thus, the challenger assumes this value has not increased, which must be confirmed or denied by the node currently in the position. To mitigate the communication overhead, the following strategy is proposed:

\begin{enumerate}

\item The challenge must only be called if the $FS_a$ of the challenger is greater than the $FS_e$ by a degree of $\delta$, i.e., $FS_a \ge \delta * FS_e$, with $\delta > 1$;

\item Assuming all eligible nodes adopt the same $\delta$, they are exempt of participating and the election happens between the challenger and the actual nodes;

\item To reduce the chances of having a failed challenge (when the actual $FS$ of the elected node has increased since it was elected), elected nodes should update their peers whenever their $FS$ has changed by a degree of $\delta$, i.e., $FS_a \ge \delta * FS_e$ or $FS_a \le (1 - \delta) * FS_e$.

\end{enumerate}

If the challenger node has indeed a higher $FS$ than its challenger, it assumes the role position and this result is advertised; otherwise, the actual fitness score of the elected node ($FS_a$) is advertised so that new challenges are based on the most updated score. The diagrams in Figures~\ref{fig:elected_node} and~\ref{fig:eligible_node} describe, respective, the protocol of an elected node and of an eligible node.



%The first and foremost overhead is due to the exchange of messages among eligible nodes ()

%like the vacancy of a role position due to churn or  resignation of the node in that position, 

%as the new node must be elected and advertised. Second, the context of the role, kept by the leaving node, may have to be transfered to the elected node (if the role is stateful). Depending on the domain of the application, other costs may apply.

%Table~\ref{fig:asymmetry} classifies these methods according to their type and their satisfaction of requirements R[1-3].

%\subsubsection{\textbf{Example}}
%
%The fitness function of an \textit{aggregator} role in a OMCS application could be modeled as: 
%
%$$
%f_{aggregator} = battery\_level * membership\_age
%$$
%
%\noindent
%in which $battery\_level$ and $membership\_age$ are both real positive numbers ranging from 0 to 1. The former parameter can be accessed from the platform hosting the node, while the last parameter refers to the time a node belongs to a group. The following function illustrates how this parameter could be evaluated:
%
%$$
%membership\_age = MIN((60 - age)/60, 1)
%$$
%
%\noindent
%in which $age$ is given in seconds and refer to the uninterrupted time a given node is in the group. Thus, if the node has been more than a minute in the group, it has a $membership\_age$ of one; otherwise, $0 \le membership\_factor \le 1$.
%
%Thus, given a set of eligible nodes, the one with the highest product of battery level and membership age becomes elected as an aggregator. 

%For example, one-out-of-many device may be a better candidate to host the coordinator of the activities performed by a group of application nodes or to use specific sensors to extract information from the physical environment. Whenever asymmetry characterizes a behavior, i.e., not every node must perform it, and the performance, the cost, or other attributes of such behavior are to be considered, the decision of which node to perform it should take the context of the hosting devices into account. In this work, we considered asymmetric tasks whose importance for the system justifies the overhead for their allocation. %We compare our approach with straightforward solutions to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a context-dependent allocation. 

%In specific, we focus on the \textit{efficiency, robustness, and fairness} resulting from an appropriate distribution of system responsibilities to local devices taking into account the dynamicity of their resources and capabilities, as well as their history of participation (fairness). To achieve a scalable solution for these problems, we propose a two-level mechanism for the partitioning of the edge space into subset of devices (groups) and the classification of these subsets by their fitness to play different system roles (assignment). 



%the partitioning of the edge space according to different criteria and

 %In special, we are concerned with system functionalities that can assigned to one or more devices within the edge space. 
%The main novelties here are:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item Pervasive and mobile devices are seen as volatile and heterogeneous computational platforms with resource limitations.
%
%\item Distinct responsibilities may be assigned to a subset of the mobile devices running the same application.
%
%\end{itemize}


%First, we show how our framework can enable ad hoc interactions without external storage and control provided by cloud infrastructure. Second, we present a mobile multi-player game scenario in which low latency communication is the main requirement. Finally, we describe a mobile crowdsensing application, which combines different requirements, including efficient use of battery and mobile data plan. 



%which here are hampered by volatility, 
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item Discovery: devices must be able to recognize each other in the space
%
%\item Transparency: devices must be able to communicate without previous knowledge of their network address
%
%\item Dynamic allocation: devices must be able to agree on the role they will play in the system 
%
%\item Partitioning: devices must be able to further partition the interaction space 
%
%\end{itemize}
