%1: The network model
\subsection{Wireless Networking}

Not only computers have pervaded the space inhabit by humans, wireless networking is quickly fulfilling the gaps in connectivity through which pervasive devices can communicate, including while in transit (Figure~\ref{fig:network_model}). Whereas the connectivity between devices was mostly restricted to the areas with a private or public Wi-Fi coverage, recent developments in device-to-device (D2D) technology expand the situations in which devices can communicate and interact. For example, in addition to the already consolidated Wi-Fi direct and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technologies, the fifth generation mobile networks (5G) standards include the support for D2D communication~\cite{Tehrani:2014}. Thus, a new and exciting landscape for pervasive and mobile computing is taking form.

%2: Nowadays Pervasive and mobile computing
\subsection{Pervasive Applications}~\label{sec:characterization}

The market of applications crafted for pervasive and specially mobile devices continues to increase as more people have access to this technology. In specific, applications can be hosted by pervasive devices with higher or less degree of mobility and computational power, such as smartphones, tables, gadges, and miniaturized computer platforms such as Raspberry PI (which now supports the Android platform for Internet of Things~\footnote{https://developer.android.com/things/hardware/raspberrypi.html}). Moreover, new types of specialized devices like Bluetooth beacons compose the rich ecosystem in which pervasive applications can run. Despite mobile computing and devices to be the preeminent type of pervasive computing, as well as the target platform for the majority of applications, we adopted \textit{pervasive} as a broader qualitative term (instead of mobile) to avoid the discrimination of pervasive devices that exhibit limit mobility, but are potential candidates for composing the diverse scenario target by this proposal.
